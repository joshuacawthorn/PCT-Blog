            <p>Matt and I fearfully pursued a threateningly mischievous foe. A suspicious red light blinked on our horizon. Into the dark, with my astonishingly bright head lamp, we pursued. The surrounding undulations of the local landscape prevented us from maintaining visibility, heightening its mystery. With an unsatisfying conclusion, we returned to camp where we could still see the suspicious red light. Nerves calmed and we rationalized it may be a traffic sign on the nearby road.</p>

            <p>An early start begged a promising day, until my own poor water management caused an otherwise optional water pit stop to be necessary. An inauspicious 2.6 mile round trip water pit stop. Although it was a literal oasis that allowed us to drink our fill, the uphill return proved to rival the core temperature of the strongest star. When we finally made it back to the designated trail, the idea for a siesta arose.</p>

<p>Surrounded by three equally novice Austrians, we shared a spot of shade under a large tree. We were waiting out what we thought was the hottest part of the day, as a Goliath of a mountain laid ahead. Satisfied we'd waited enough time, we braved ahead to what we'd soon modestly call "That Hill."<p/>

<p>I'm not confident the English language has enough adjectives to accurately describe the discomfort faced attempting to summit That Hill, but I'd start with terms like "hot" and "steep" and "hard."</p>

<p>Surprisingly, we completed it. With "just" three or four more miles until our ambiguous destination, we bee-bopped along.</p>

<p>We arrived at a rather well kept campground that had a portion segmented off just for us PCT hikers. As the afternoon wore on, tent after tent popped up. Welcome to shantytown!</p>

<p>Tonight's episode featured a sassy gay man that generously shared his drugs with us, a YouTube celebrity that I've obviously never heard of, and one woman that was arguably attractive enough.</p>

<p>A dozen or so others crawled about the camp, most minding their own business. We all took turns making runs to the little liquor store less than half a mile down the road. And what a liquor store, let me tell ya. There was a small kitchen and large woman cooking, hand making pizzas (from scratch), frying burgers and chicken and French fries, and I even saw her deliver a rather thorough salad to someone. 10/10 liquor store on Yelp, no question.</p>

            <h3>4/5/2018 – Day 3: Getting Stronger</h3>
<img src="images/2018-04-05-IMG_20180405_172919" alt="The Sugarman and Big Mac">
            <p>In August of the previous year, Matt and I hiked a portion of the PCT in an attempt to train. That section that we hiked was the same section we completed today. There were some stark differences in today's experience versus the previous:</p>

<p>Dramatically superior gear</p>
<p>Favorable weather conditions</p>
<p>Wisdom</p>

<p>I was nervous to reproduce this portion of the hike, as it was so hellacious the previous time. The most striking difference is in how different I feel at the end of the hike today. Although we made it 12 miles, I wasn't suffering the same physical exhaustion I'd feel before. I just feel... Stronger.</p>

<p>Today, Matt and I earned our hiking names. Matt has been donned Big Mac, because of his physical resemblance to a character on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. And for Matt's love of the McDonald's sandwich. I was given the name "Sugarman," although I much prefer its full name: "The Sugarman."</p>

<p>As Matt astutely pointed out, our names make us sound like 1970's pimps: Big Mac and Sugarman </p>
